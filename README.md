# SpeedySkeleton.io

Built with [Bone.IO](http://bone.io/) and Skeleton.css, this is a flat-file CMS, much like [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) and [cms.js](https://cdmedia.github.io/cms.js/). I wanted this because I felt that cms.js didn't have enough documentation on how to expand the functionalities such grouping posts by type, and Grav was a lot to take. I also want users to be able to easily apply themes found around the internet.

### Why Bone.IO?

Although Bone.IO is intended to work with Socket and hasn't seen a commit in 3 years, as of March 3rd, 2017, I really liked the way it would allow me to organize logic. I'm also currently working on a bigger project that also uses Bone.IO.

### Why Skeleton.CSS?

It's basically the bare minimum to have a responsive website.

### How to Use?
